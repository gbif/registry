# GBIF Registry Domain

This module includes classes and interfaces which are common for several registry modules.
It depends only on [gbif-api](https://github.com/gbif/gbif-api), [guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).

**IMPORTANT** commons-validator dependency must be removed from the module.
