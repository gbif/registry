          <description>
            <para>This dataset is compiled from data collected in a combination of collaborative surveys with scientists, targeted RLS field campaigns and ad-hoc local surveys by trained RLS divers at their regular dive sites or when on holidays. Field campaigns involve small groups of divers (usually 4 to 8) undertaking survey dives over a period of four days to two weeks (or occasionally longer) under the direction and supervision of a scientist or experienced survey diver. At the conclusion of each field campaign, one of the RLS organizers or scientists leading the trip collates data from participants and undertakes manual checks of the data. These checks included close scrutiny of species lists, abundances and site details. Evidence in the form of images is usually requested for records of species not seen by the experienced surveyor on the trip, with such evidence essential for divers with less experience in that particular region. Uncertain records or records of new species for regions for which definitive evidence is not available are reduced to the highest taxonomic resolution for which there is confidence (usually genus). For ad-hoc surveys by trained divers outside of group field campaigns, species identification assistance and data transfer occur via email, and all the data checks are made by a scientist in the office before uploading data to the database.</para>

        <samplingDescription>
          <para>The RLS global reef fish dataset includes data from more than 2,500 sites, collected using standard RLS survey methods, described in detail in an online methods manual (Reef Life Survey methods manual. http://reeflifesurvey.com/reef-life-survey/about-rls/methods/). Surveys involve underwater visual census (UVC) by SCUBA divers along a 50 m transect line, laid along a depth contour on hard substrate (coral or rocky reef). All fish species observed within 5 m of the transect line were recorded on a waterproof datasheet as divers swim slowly along the line.

Abundance estimates are made by keeping a tally of individuals of less abundant species and, in locations with high fish densities, estimating the number of more abundant species. Abundances of schooling fishes are recorded by counting a subset within the school which is combined with an estimate of the proportion of the total school. In coral reefs with high fish species richness and densities, the order of priority for recording accurately is to first ensure all species observed along transects are included, then tallies of individuals of larger or rare species, then finally estimates of abundance for more common species. Only divers with the most extensive and appropriate experience undertake surveys in diverse coral reefs.

Nearly all fishes observed are identified to species level, with photographs of unknown species taken with an underwater digital camera for later identification using appropriate field guides and consultation with taxonomic experts for the particular group, as necessary. When species level identification is not possible, records are classified at the highest taxonomic resolution possible given the information available and experience of the observer. As of 2015, 1.8% of records in the RLS global reef fish dataset were not at the species level (i.e., are at genus level or higher).

Fishes within 5 m of the line are recorded separately for each side of the transect line, with each side referred to as a ‘block’. Thus, two blocks form a complete transect (also referred to as an individual survey). Multiple transects are usually surveyed at each site, usually along different depth contours. Sites are distinguished by unique site codes with latitude and longitude recorded in decimal degrees (WGS84) using a handheld GPS unit, or taken from Google Earth.</para>

          <para>Data in the RLS global reef fish dataset have been collected by a combination of experienced scientists and skilled recreational divers, with all divers having either substantial prior experience in reef fish surveys or extensive training in the RLS methods. Screening of interested divers is undertaken before training so that only the most committed and capable divers with appropriate SCUBA experience are invited to participate. Although a minimum of 50 dives’ experience is used as a standard in diver selection, a survey of RLS divers in 2010 indicated that most RLS divers had completed over 300 dives. For divers without prior formal scientific training, one-on-one instruction in survey methods and assistance with species identification is provided during a training course typically lasting four to five days, but up to two weeks (depending on local marine life and skills of the diver). During these courses, trainees undertake practice surveys with an experienced scientist, who carefully compares their data following each dive, with a final approval given after data are considered to be of high consistency with the trainer. A formal comparison of data collected by divers without tertiary scientific training with data collected by experienced scientists showed that the variation between recreational and scientific divers was non-significant and negligible in comparison to other sources of variation within and between sites.

Following each survey, each RLS diver transcribes their data from the underwater datasheets onto custom data entry forms. This is usually done the same day as survey dives are undertaken. Data entry templates contain lookups from region-specific species lists. Data checks are made upon upload of forms to the database, including for data structure (and completeness) and consistency in metadata among divers, as well as checks designed to detect species not previously recorded by RLS divers in that particular region. Any new species added for a given region prompt querying of the records, and taxonomic and distributional data are also checked before addition of new species to the database.</para>

      <abstract>
        <para>Reef Life Survey (RLS) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods. RLS activities depend on the skills of experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers and partnerships with management agencies and university researchers.</para>
      </abstract>
      <funding>
        <para>RLS activities are presently funded primarily through grants from biodiversity management agencies and philanthropic organisations, and with in-kind contributions and support from SCUBA charter operators and shops. Further funding sources and sustainable funding models are being sought to allow long-term continuation of RLS data collection at larger scales.</para>

          <para>As of December 2015, the majority of global data represent once-off surveys designed to fill spatial gaps and provide an extensive coverage of reefs around the world. Time-series data from repeat surveys of particular reef sites as part of a monitoring program has largely been confined to some key locations in Australia. A key goal of RLS is to extend to number of locations at which time-series data are collected, undertaking monitoring in many more countries.</para>
