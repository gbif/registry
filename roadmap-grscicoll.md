# GRSciColl Catalogue priority roadmap 2023

This roadmap builds in the [2021 roadmap](https://github.com/gbif/registry/blob/dev/roadmap-grscicoll-2021.md) as well as the efforts in 2022 to build a community of editors an mediators.

## Establish a new public site for GRSciColl (rebranded, outside of GBIF.org)Â 

This build on the work mentioned in the 2021 roadmap of developing a richer user interface and the need to make GRSciColl more visible.

## Enable specimen search and browse capability to the catalogue

In addition to making specimen-related occurrences linked to GRSciColl searchable on the new public website, the catalogue should also support the richer data model as it becomes available.

## Make GRSciColl compatible with Latimer Core (TDWG Collection description standards)

GRSciColl should be compatible with Latimer Core [[REG-176](https://github.com/gbif/registry/issues/176)].

## Explore making GRSciColl a better tool to monitor data mobilisation efforts.

Explore how GRSciColl could be used to generate national views and tracking trends in available specimen data (i.e. output of digitisation effort) published through GBIF.
