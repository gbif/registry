Thanks for registering at GBIF.org. You're ready now to download the results of your searches of the hundreds of millions
of free and open biodiversity records made available by the GBIF community of participants and publishers.

<h1>Next steps</h1>

<h2>Cite the data you download</h2>

<p>The data accessed through GBIF.org represents the work of scientists, researchers, curators, data and IT specialists,
    and other professionals in hundreds of organizations around the world. When you use the <i>DOI</i> (Digital Object Identifier)
    assigned to each search result you download, you help ensure that they get full credit for their efforts.</p>

<p>The DOI is included in the confirmation email you receive when your download is ready, and your account profile also
    maintains a record of all your download DOIs. By citing data in this way, you can simplify the references in your research,
    ensure your ability to repeat or update search results, and link uses directly to relevant datasets,
    enabling us to automate the reporting of those uses to publishers and users alike. <a href="https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines">Want more details?</a></p>

<h2>Join one of the communities</h2>

<p>For questions and discussions about use of GBIF-mediated data, please join the <a href="https://discourse.gbif.org/">GBIF community forum</a> launched in May 2018.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/api-users">GBIF API users list</a> provides an active peer-to-peer discussion
    group where you can post questions and stay informed on updates to the GBIF API and underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p>With the release of our new website in August 2017, we now expect to turn our attention to developing a replacement
    to the legacy GBIF community site, enabling you to interact and learn from others who share your interests.
    Please contact <a href="mailto:communication@gbif.org">communication@gbif.org</a> if you have specific ideas or suggestions related to this work.</p>
